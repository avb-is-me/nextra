High Level

The `image.scan` method is used to iterate over each pixel in an image and perform a specific action on each pixel. This method is useful for tasks such as image processing, object detection, and image manipulation.

## Why should I use this function?

The `image.scan` method is a powerful tool for performing pixel-level operations on images. It allows you to access and modify the individual pixels of an image, giving you complete control over the image data. This method is particularly useful for tasks that require precise control over the image, such as image processing, object detection, and image manipulation.

## What is params or arguements required?

The `image.scan` method takes the following parameters:

* `x`: The x-coordinate of the starting pixel.
* `y`: The y-coordinate of the starting pixel.
* `width`: The width of the area to be scanned.
* `height`: The height of the area to be scanned.
* `callback`: A function that will be called for each pixel in the specified area. The callback function takes the following parameters:
    * `x`: The x-coordinate of the current pixel.
    * `y`: The y-coordinate of the current pixel.
    * `idx`: The index of the current pixel in the image data array.

## Prequsites

Before using the `image.scan` method, you must first import the `Jimp` library into your project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install jimp
```

Once you have installed the `Jimp` library, you can import it into your project by adding the following line to your code:

```
const Jimp = require('jimp');
```

## How do I use this function?

To use the `image.scan` method, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new `Jimp` image object.
2. Call the `scan` method on the image object, specifying the starting pixel, width, height, and callback function.
3. In the callback function, you can access and modify the individual pixels of the image.

Here is an example of how to use the `image.scan` method to make all of the pixels in an image transparent:

```
const image = new Jimp(200, 200);

image.scan(0, 0, image.bitmap.width, image.bitmap.height, function (x, y, idx) {
    // Set the alpha value of the current pixel to 0 (transparent)
    this.bitmap.data[idx + 3] = 0;
});
```

## Conclusion

The `image.scan` method is a powerful tool for performing pixel-level operations on images. It allows you to access and modify the individual pixels of an image, giving you complete control over the image data. This method is particularly useful for tasks that require precise control over the image, such as image processing, object detection, and image manipulation.
