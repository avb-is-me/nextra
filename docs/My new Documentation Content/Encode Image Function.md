* Sending images over the network: Base64-encoded images can be sent over the network more efficiently than raw image files.

To use the `encodeImage` function, simply call it with the path to the image file that you want to convert. The function will return a base64-encoded string that represents the image.

Here is an example of how to use the `encodeImage` function:

```javascript
const image = fs.readFileSync('image.png');
const base64Image = encodeImage(image);
